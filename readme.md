## Project - Using Keras neural net for credit card fraud detection to classify COVID-cases

Using machine learning methods to predict COVID-19 diagnoses in the Swiss population.

Approach 1 applies a neural network in Keras. The analysis builds on the example analysis to classify credit card fraud by Fancois Chollet (https://keras.io/examples/structured_data/imbalanced_classification/).

Approach 2 uses imbalanced classification methods implemented in sklearn based on https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-and-class-imbalances-eacb296e776f

This is work in progress.

The data used here can be visually inspected here: https://idheapunitepolsoc.shinyapps.io/covid_dashboard/
