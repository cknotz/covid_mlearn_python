## Project - Using Keras neural net for credit card fraud detection to classify COVID-cases

Using a Keras neural network designed to classify credit card fraud to predict COVID-19 diagnoses in the Swiss population. The analysis builds on the example by Fancois Chollet (https://keras.io/examples/structured_data/imbalanced_classification/).

This is work in progress.

The data used here can be visually inspected here: https://idheapunitepolsoc.shinyapps.io/covid_dashboard/
